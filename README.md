# WeatherProject
____
### In this application you need to type a city name in order to get the real time temperature and weather (with its icon). The "openweathermap" api was used and I decided to include my own appid in the code so you can use the api without create an account.
____
### This project was developed through node.js and the "express" and "body-parser" modules. If you want to run it locally therefore you will have to install the previously mentioned modules (the terminal command is the following: "npm i express, body-parser"). The https module is also used, but it's a native node.js module so you don't need to install it.
