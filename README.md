# WeatherProject
____
### In this application you need to type a city name in order to get the real time temperature and weather (with its icon). The "openweathermap" api was used and I decided to include my own appid in the code so you can use the api without create an account.
____
### This project was developed through node.js and the "express" and "body-parser" modules. If you want to run it locally therefore you will have to install the previously mentioned modules (the terminal command is the following: "npm i express body-parser"). The https module is also used, but it's a native node.js module so you don't need to install it. If you haven't used Node much then you must know that to run the application you have to go to the project folder (with the terminal) and run the main file with the following command: "node app.js"
